# Artificial Neural Network Generator
This is an attempt to generate a usable/approximate artificial neural network for the data and the goal that are given by the user.

The goal should describe the problem that the user wants to solve. The data should represent the goal.
From the goal and the data, the program cleans and prepares the proper inputs and outputs. Then, it generates an artificial neural network that uses the prepared input/output achieve the goal.

## Idea
Instead of cleaning the data by hands, use some programs to perform the data preparation depending on the types of data and the goal of the user.

Since artificial neural network is a function, perform some type of function search in the functional space of ANN.
