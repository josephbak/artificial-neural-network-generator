# Artificial Neural Network Generator
This is an attempt to generate a usable/approximate artificial neural network for a task that is given by the user in text form.

The text should describe the problem that the user wants to solve. From the text, the program identifies the proper inputs and outputs. Then, it generates an artificial neural network that meets the input/output criteria.
